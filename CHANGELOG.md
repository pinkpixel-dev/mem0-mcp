# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.4] - 2025-05-28

### ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING** - `app_id` and `run_id` Parameters
- **SUCCESS**: Confirmed that `app_id` and `run_id` parameters are now working correctly!
- **Dashboard Behavior**: Parameters appear in individual memory details (Event Details panel) as expected
- **API Version**: Re-added `version="v2"` for add operations as recommended by Mem0 docs (v1 is deprecated)
- **UI Limitation**: Mem0 dashboard doesn't show `app_id`/`run_id` in main list view by design - this is normal behavior

### 📝 Research Findings
- Mem0 stores `app_id` and `run_id` as first-class fields, not in metadata
- Dashboard UI focuses on user/agent groupings; `app_id`/`run_id` appear in memory details and are fully queryable
- Parameters are working correctly - the "missing" display in main list was expected behavior
- All memory operations now use proper API versions and endpoints

### 🎯 Status
- ✅ Project scoping via `app_id` - **WORKING**
- ✅ Session tracking via `run_id` - **WORKING**
- ✅ Agent identification via `agent_id` - **WORKING**
- ✅ Memory organization and filtering - **WORKING**

## [0.5.3] - 2025-05-28

### 🔧 Fixed
- **API Endpoint Corrections**:
  - Add Memory: Uses `/v1/memories/`
  - Search Memory: Uses `/v1/memories/search/` with `version=v2` parameter
  - Delete Memory: Uses `/v1/memories/{id}/`
- Fixed delete endpoint URL from `/v2/memories/{id}` to `/v1/memories/{id}/`

## [0.5.2] - 2025-05-28

### 🔧 Fixed
- **API Call Priority**: Now prioritizes direct REST API calls over Node.js SDK when `app_id` or `run_id` parameters are provided
- **Enhanced Parameter Support**: Ensures `app_id` and `run_id` parameters are properly passed to Mem0 API for project scoping and session tracking
- **Better Debugging**: Added specific logging when using direct API calls for parameter-sensitive operations

### 📝 Technical Details
- Modified both `add_memory` and `search_memory` methods to use direct REST API calls when `app_id` or `sessionId` parameters are present
- The Node.js SDK appears to have limitations with certain parameters, so direct API calls ensure full parameter support
- Maintains backward compatibility while ensuring all parameters work correctly
- Added fallback logic to SDK if direct API calls fail

## [0.5.1] - 2025-05-28

### 📝 Documentation
- Updated README with comprehensive parameter configuration guide
- Added system prompt recommendations for LLM usage
- Enhanced examples showing correct parameter usage
- Clarified that org_id/project_id are auto-assigned by Mem0

## [0.5.0] - 2025-05-28

### 🎯 **BREAKING CHANGE - Correct Parameter Implementation**
- **MAJOR FIX**: Replaced incorrect `orgId`/`projectId` parameters with correct Mem0 API parameters
- **Parameter Mapping**:
  - `agentId` - The LLM/agent making the tool call
  - `userId` - The user's identifier
  - `appId` - The user's project/application (this controls project scope!)
  - `sessionId` - Maps to `run_id` for session tracking
- **Environment Fallbacks**: Added `DEFAULT_AGENT_ID` and `DEFAULT_APP_ID` environment variables
- **API Compliance**: Now uses correct Mem0 API parameters (`app_id`, `agent_id`, `run_id`) instead of non-functional org/project IDs

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Root Cause**: org_id and project_id are set by Mem0 automatically and cannot be changed by users
- **Correct Scope Control**: app_id is what actually controls the user's project scope in Mem0
- **Parameter Precedence**: Tool parameters take precedence over environment variable defaults
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive parameter resolution logging for debugging

### 📝 Technical Details
- Removed all references to `orgId`/`projectId` (these are auto-assigned by Mem0)
- Implemented proper `app_id` parameter for project scoping
- Updated tool schemas to reflect correct parameter names and descriptions
- Added fallback logic for `DEFAULT_AGENT_ID` and `DEFAULT_APP_ID` environment variables
- Updated direct REST API calls to use correct parameter names

## [0.4.2] - 2025-05-28

### 🔧 Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Added fallback to direct REST API calls when Node.js SDK doesn't properly handle org_id/project_id parameters
- **SDK Limitation Workaround**: Node.js SDK appears to ignore org_id/project_id parameters, so we now use direct REST API calls as fallback
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with automatic fallback from SDK to direct API calls
- **Better Debugging**: Added detailed logging for both SDK attempts and direct API calls to help identify issues

### 📝 Technical Details
- When `cloudClient.add()` or `cloudClient.search()` fails or ignores org/project parameters, automatically falls back to direct REST API calls
- Direct API calls use proper `https://api.mem0.ai/v1/memories/` endpoints with full parameter support
- Maintains backward compatibility while ensuring org_id and project_id parameters work correctly
- Added comprehensive request/response logging for debugging

## [0.4.1] - 2025-05-28

### 🔧 Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed organizationId and projectId from client-level initialization to fix environment variable fallbacks
- **Parameter Override Issue**: Client-level org/project settings were overriding per-request parameters, preventing environment variables and tool parameters from working
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track parameter resolution and API call options
- **Environment Variable Fallbacks**: ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID environment variables now work correctly when tool parameters are omitted

### 📝 Technical Details
- Removed `organizationId` and `projectId` from MemoryClient constructor options
- Client-level settings were preventing per-request `org_id` and `project_id` parameters from taking effect
- Added detailed logging to help debug parameter resolution issues
- Environment variable fallback logic now works as intended

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-27

### 🔧 Fixed
- **BREAKING FIX**: Fixed client initialization issue where org_id and project_id set at client level were overriding per-request values
- **API Parameter Format**: Changed API method parameters from camelCase to snake_case to match Mem0 REST API specification
  - `userId` → `user_id`
  - `orgId` → `org_id`
  - `projectId` → `project_id`
  - `agentId` → `agent_id`
  - `sessionId` → `session_id`
  - `customCategories` → `custom_categories`
  - `customInstructions` → `custom_instructions`
  - `outputFormat` → `output_format`
  - `expirationDate` → `expiration_date`
  - `topK` → `top_k`
  - `keywordSearch` → `keyword_search`
  - `filterMemories` → `filter_memories`
- **Client Initialization**: Now properly sets organizationId and projectId at client level using camelCase (as expected by JavaScript SDK)
- **Environment Variable Fallbacks**: ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID environment variable fallbacks now work properly when explicit parameters are not provided

### 🚀 Improved
- Enhanced error messages to include API response details for better debugging
- Added comprehensive parameter validation and logging
- Improved client initialization logging to show which parameters are being used

### 📝 Notes
- This version fixes the core issue where organization and project IDs were not being properly passed to the Mem0 API
- Users should now see their memories properly scoped to their organization and project
- Environment variable fallbacks (ORG_ID, PROJECT_ID) will now work as expected when tool parameters are omitted

- 🔧 Fixed configuration generator indentation issues and removed unused session ID environment variables
- 📝 Clarified that session IDs are tool parameters, not environment variables

## [0.3.2] - 2025-04-20

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `threshold` parameter in `search_memory` tool when using cloud storage mode. The parameter is now properly handled to ensure it's never passed as null to the Mem0 API, which was causing errors for some users.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-04-05

### Added
- ✨ Added `delete_memory` tool to remove specific memories by ID.
- ☁️ Implemented support for Mem0 Cloud API using `MEM0_API_KEY`.
- 🏢 Added optional support for `ORG_ID` and `PROJECT_ID` environment variables for Cloud API scoping.
- 🔄 Added dynamic switching between Cloud API (if `MEM0_API_KEY` is present) and local in-memory storage (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present).

## [0.2.7] - 2025-04-08

### Added
- New MCP tool: `delete_memory` for removing specific memories by ID
- Comprehensive documentation for advanced Mem0 API parameters
- Detailed explanation of filters and comparison operators for the search functionality

### Fixed
- Fixed mapping between `sessionId` and `run_id` in search functionality for cloud API
- Clarified in-memory storage limitations in documentation

## [0.2.5] - 2025-04-05

### Fixed
- Implemented `SafeLogger` class to selectively redirect console.log calls from mem0ai library to stderr without breaking MCP protocol
- Fixed critical issue where stdout writes from internal libraries were disrupting the MCP communication protocol
- Added environment variable configurations to minimize debug logging from libraries
- Improved error handling and cleanup on process exit

## [0.1.7] - 2025-04-05

### Fixed
- Fixed MCP communication by removing all `console` logging that was interfering with the stdout protocol channel.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-04-05

### Changed
- Reverted `search_memory` tool description and schema to explicitly require `userId`, removing misleading "optional" phrasing related to the `DEFAULT_USER_ID` fallback.
- Added documentation to `README.md` explaining the `DEFAULT_USER_ID` environment variable and its use as a server-side fallback for `search_memory` if the `userId` argument is omitted (though providing `userId` in the call is recommended).


## [0.1.5]- 2025-04-05

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where memories were not being stored correctly due to unconfigured default database (Qdrant). Explicitly configured `mem0ai` client to use the in-memory vector store by default, ensuring basic functionality works out-of-the-box.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-04-05

### Added
- Initial functional Node.js/TypeScript implementation of `@pinkpixel/mem0-mcp`.
